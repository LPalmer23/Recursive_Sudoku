# Recursive_Sudoku

This Java project solves 9x9 Sudoku puzzles using recursive backtracking. 

Key Features: 
* Recursive method (solveRB) explores and backtracks through possible board values. Tracks row, column and subgrid constraints using 2D and 3D arrays
* Modular helper methods for placing, removing, and validating values
* Reads puzzles from a .txt file and prints both the initial and solved board
